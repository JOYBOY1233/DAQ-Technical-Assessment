## Spyder
Step 1:
 - I added the nodemon execution for only the dev script whenever the dev script is run.

Step 2:
- I created a new helper function called validateData which checks whether or not the data received from dataEmulator is a number and also is in the right object form.
- Everytime that invalid data is passed i print to the terminal that invalid data was passed and the time at which it was passed similar to how it displays when valid data is passed.

Step 3:
- I added a helper function called alertFunciton that monitors the temperature of the battery and warns the user when the temp exceeds the limits 3 times within a 5 second window.
